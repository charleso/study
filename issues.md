I've long been interested a distributed issue tracker and review system.

My interest has been re-ignited by the recent post from JaneStreet about their
tool for doing reviews locally.

## [SD](http://syncwith.us/sd/)

I love that this had support from "pulling" from different types of issue
trackers (ie. bugzilla).

It's clearly dead now though unfortunately.

I don't really like the all-in-one approach here, but it seems quite mature.
