## Git

Git was my obsession for many, _many_ years.
I've mostly saturated that interest and don't pay much attention to that
world any more. Git is a useful tool that I have (I guess) mastered, and there
are more important things to be focussing on.

I [wrote a slightly inflammatory blog for Atlassian years ago](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/git/git-vs-mercurial-why-git)
when I joined. I regret both the tone and the arguments I made, especially
given that some the points were just plain incorrect.

## Mercurial

I started with Mercurial when I first switched away from SVN all those years
ago. At the time the branching just seemed clumsy and didn't fit with my
sloppy approach to working.


### Monorepo

Facebook have done some impressive work on scaling their use of a single
repository. I can see this being _extremely_ attractive to companies that want
to avoid the burden of managing small repositories.
